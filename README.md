# C&CB

A demonstration of a "Kanban style board" using React and drag and drop.

This is just a Proof of Concept and is in no way production ready:

## Tasks to make production ready:
- [ ] Profile picture to be specified in card data.
- [ ] Better linting. (not fond of Facebook's default rules.)
  - mainly so it's easier to know if I left in console logs and such
- [ ] Unit tests
- [ ] In Browser automation tests
- [ ] Accessibility tagging (ARIA roles, etc)
- [ ] proper state managment (Redux)
- [ ] Data module to handle API calls and state transfers between client <-> server
- [ ] Proper build / deployment script (currently just running as `npm start`)
